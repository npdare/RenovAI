Design Application: AI-Powered Home Design Visualiser

1. Upload Original Photo

Users can upload a photo of a space — either interior or exterior.

Supported file types should include JPG, PNG, and HEIC.

Ensure a minimum resolution (e.g., 1024x768) to maintain image quality.

Optional feature: Use a machine learning model to automatically detect whether the photo is of an interior or exterior space.

2. Provide Design Inspiration

Users can provide inspiration in three ways:

Text Prompt: Freeform text input describing the desired style (e.g., "modern boho with natural textures and pastel tones").

Reference Images: Upload one or more images showing the look they want to achieve.

Pinterest Board URL: Allow users to paste a Pinterest board link. Use scraping or the Pinterest API to extract style cues from the pinned images.

3. Extract Design Parameters

Use a combination of image recognition (e.g., OpenAI CLIP or a vision model) and language models (e.g., GPT) to extract structured design information.

Extracted design parameters may include:

Style (e.g., industrial, Scandinavian, coastal)

Materials (e.g., wood, concrete, rattan)

Colour palette (e.g., whites, pastels, dark tones)

Furniture types and layouts

Optionally show the extracted parameters to the user and allow them to confirm or edit the interpretation.

4. Transform Original Photo

Use an image-to-image AI model (such as Stable Diffusion with ControlNet or RunwayML) to apply the design parameters to the uploaded photo.

The model should maintain the room's structure and layout while modifying surfaces, furniture, textures, and colours based on the design prompt.

Output a high-quality image showing the same scene with the new design style applied.

5. Review and Fine-Tune

Users can adjust how strongly the design is applied using a slider (e.g., 0% to 100% transformation).

Provide options to generate variations or request changes (e.g., “Try it with lighter floors”).

Let users re-upload inspiration or modify prompts to regenerate results.

6. Export and Share

Allow users to download the final image, or a before/after comparison.

Provide a shareable link for viewing or embedding.

If the user has an account, let them save the session for later access or editing.

Core Technologies (Suggested Stack)

Frontend: React or Next.js for building a responsive UI

Styling: Tailwind CSS for clean and modern design

Backend: Node.js or Python with FastAPI for handling API calls

Image Generation: Stable Diffusion with ControlNet to retain layout while changing design

Design Parameter Extraction: Use GPT-4 Vision or CLIP + GPT to understand and summarise design inputs

File Storage: AWS S3 or Firebase Storage for saving images

User Auth (Optional): Firebase Auth or Auth0 for user accounts

Pinterest Integration (Optional): Pinterest API or custom scraper to pull images and tags

Optional Features to Add Later

Allow users to highlight areas of the photo to change (e.g., walls only).

Add augmented reality (AR) view to see the design in real space.

Let users choose from preset design templates or AI-recommended looks.
